# TODO: there is no LDAP testing here because to
# accurately simulate the real use case, we would need
# the chef-server pedant is running on to be LDAP configured,
# and we would want that LDAP server to be down.
#
# This is too intergration-test-ish for pedant, but it is a case
# we should be testing. It'd be great if our CI test spun up an
# AD server, then configured and ran these tests with an LDAP user.
#
# LDAP status is not expected to affect this endpoint in any way
# but we would obviously want to test the server in a state we
# actually expect to see when this endpoint would be used in the real world.
#
# Basically what I'm saying is we should have integration testing and
# that pedant is the wrong place to do such an infrastructure / service-interactive test.
